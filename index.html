At present the popularity of the mobile phone is increasing. Many companies are also being set up for selling mobile phone. The price of mobile phone is also decreasing in comparison with the past. People are being encouraged to buy a mobile-phone set at a cheaper rate. However due to mobile phone, the whole world seems to be a global village. In a very single moment, we can communicate with the people living in a very distant place. With all its advantages, the mobile phone has still some drawbacks in disguise. Though the price of it is decreasing, per minute bill is not decreasing. So everybody cannot possess it. Scientists have recently discovered that mobile phone can cause cancer to the users. Besides, it has become a fashion with the young people. Last but not the least, terrorists are using it to spread out terrorism all around the world. But in spite of all these disadvantages, it can be finalised here that the necessity of a mobile phone in exchanging messages, cannot be denied in the true sense of the term in our practical life.</p>
