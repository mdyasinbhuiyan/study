      <p class="content__p">A national flag is a matter of pride for a nation. Every independent nation in the world has a national flag of its own. A national flag symbolizes the independence and sovereignty of a free nation. As an independent nation, we have a national flag. Our national flag is the symbol of Independence, sovereignty and prosperity. It is rectangular in size. There is a red circle in the midst of green. The ratio of the length and width of the flag is 10:6. It is made of cloth of green and red colour. Red and green colours are used in it. The green symbilizes youth while the red symbolizes the sacrifice of the valiant freedom fighters who laid down their lives for our freedom. It is hoisted atop public buildings and educational institutions during office hours. The national flag is kept half-mast on national mourning days. Our national flag is our identity. It is the symbol of our hard-earned Independence. We consider it to be our sacred possession. As it is the symbol of our sovereignty, independence and prosperity, we must be up and doing to uphold its honour by being united in the protection of our sovereignty and in the maintenance of peace within the country.</p>

      <p class="content__p">A winter morning is a cold morning of the winter season. It is cold and foggy. There is dense fog everywhere. Sometimes the fog is so dense that the sun rays can not get through it. Even things at a little distance can hardly be seen. Bird's chirpping is not heard. The cow and other animals can not come out. But it is not so every morning. Dew drops fall on leaves and blades of grass at night. They look like glittering pearls when the rays of the morning sun fall on them. Village children and people have hardly warm cloths. They gather straw and dry leaves to make fire to warm themselves. The old and the poor bask in the sun in order to warm themselves. People in general and children get up late. So everyone is busy in taking breakfast, dressing and getting ready for going to their respective places. In a winter morning one can enjoy delicious and sweet cakes, payesh of date juice and many other things. The scene of the winter morning vanishes as the day advances. The sun goes up and the fog melts. A winter morning is enjoyable in many respects.</p>

      <span class="content__span">5</span>
      <p class="content__p">Tree plantation means planting more trees in a planned way. It is very essential for our survival on earth. But we are cutting down of trees recklessly and thereby endangering our own lives. The world's temperatures are getting warmer gradually. Plantation of trees is thus a crying need of the time. Other than the aforesaid issue, trees come to our help in many ways. Trees take carbon dioxide, give us oxygen and prevent air pollution. They also give us shelter, shade, foods, fruits etc. They help our environment in many ways. They prevent soll erosion. They make our land fertile. They save us from droughts, floods, cyclones etc. They prevent our region from becoming a desert. Without sufficient trees, there will be less rainfall in the country. The climate will be hot. Different kinds of natural disasters will come. People will suffer from the shortage of food, shade and oxygen. Birds and animals will lose their habitats. There will be no ecological balance. A country should have at least 25% forest lands. But there are no sufficient forest lands in our country. So, necessary steps should be taken to have more trees. People should be conscious about planting more trees. The mass media like TV and radio can play a great role in this regard. To lead peaceful life, we have to plant more trees. In our country, July and August are the suitable time for planting trees. During that time we should plant more and more trees. If we do not plant more trees, our existence will be no longer in the world.</p>

      <p class="content__p">A school magazine is a magazine that contains the writings of the teachers and the students of a school. Almost every well established school publishes a magazine every year. It gives a view of the life of the school and reveals the creative genius of the students. It contains poems, articles and short stories-all written by the teachers and students. The publication of a school magazine is a very difficult task. The editor and his assistants have to work hard to publish the magazine. The magazine committee invites writings from students and teachers. The editorial board selects the qualified ones for printing. The school magazine serves many useful purposes. The most important is that it brings out the latent creative talents of the students and thus helps them to be great writers. A student feels proud and happy when he finds his own writing in print. The school magazine also reflects the academic and co- curricular activities of the school. It is a treasure Island to the students. The students can learn many things from the school magazine. In a word the school magazine mirrors the school.</p>
