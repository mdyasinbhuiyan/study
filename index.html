      <h2 class="content__h2">A Greedy Farmer and His Wonderful Goose</h2>
      <span class="content__span">Story Writing</span>
      <p class="content__p">Once upon a time there lived a farmer in a village. He was very poor. He could not maintain his family affluently. That's why he always thought about how he could remove his poverty. One day he bought a wonderful goose from the market. He hoped that he would get many eggs from this goose and by selling these eggs he would remove his poverty. Within a few days, the goose started laying eggs and amazingly it laid a golden egg every morning without a break. The farmer was very happy to see this. He sold these golden eggs in the market and became rich within a few days. But the farmer was very greedy. He wanted to be rich overnight. That's why he wanted to get all the eggs at once. He thought that by cutting the belly of the goose, he would get all the eggs at once and become rich selling those eggs. He won't have to wait any longer to be rich. He told his plan to his wife. His wife was very intelligent and wise but not greedy. She forbade her husband to cut the belly of the goose but his husband did not listen to her. Finally, according to the plan, the farmer cut the belly of the goose with a sharp knife but unfortunately there were no eggs in the belly. The goose died and the farmer began to cry sitting down hopelessly. In fact, the farmer's excessive greed and uncontrolled desire to be rich overnight took him back to his previous state.</p>
